# Virtual Environment Course Project

## Title: "A Comparative Study on Object Searching and Selection under different Spatial Arrangements of data in Web Based Immersive Environment"

##System Information 

X3DOM development version 1.7.2 was used to implement and test picking. 
Since WebVR currently works only in Nightly build of Firefox and Chromium browsers, we used 48.0a1 version of Firefox Nightly which has the Mozilla WebVR Plus 0.5.0 add-on enabled. 
The Leap Motion Software version 2.3.1 was used without the VR Mount. 
Current implementation assumes that Leap Motion is placed on a desk, facing upwards or held by the less dominant hand (facing up) when performing select/deselect with the dominant hand.
